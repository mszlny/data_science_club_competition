My work submitted to the [Data Science Club] (https://dataklub.hu) III. Competition, with which I managed to win the competition. The repository contains the submitted .ipynb file, in which I performed the analysis itself, and also contains two .pdf files. The first one (MT_final.pdf) contains a more detailed description of my results, while the second one (Data36_MT_presentation.pdf) contains the .ppt presented in the final of the competition. The presentations and the code comments are also in Hungarian.
